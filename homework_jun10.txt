It is acceptable to use CamelCase when naming classes.

You typically use do...end instead of {...} when constructing iterators that span multiple lines.

Assert checks to see if the value of something is true.  Assert_equal checks to see is something is equal to someting else.

We put the code that needs to be run before the test in the setup method.  We put the code that needs to run after the test in the teardown method.

After supplying the path to a directory run "spec ." and RSpec will run all of the specs in the current and subdirectories.

A stub is used to provide cannned answers to methods when testing to help mimic methods being called.

A mock is a more is a more "involved" stub that goes the extra mile by providing the proper responses to return and which arguments to call when testing.

You want to make sure tests fail so you know they are testing importing things within your code.

Exercising code a little bit means to check for the bare minimums (i.e. the test document is a class, the file exists and doesn't contain major errors.)
