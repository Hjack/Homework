The "unless" statement can be used to execute conditions that are false.

The "negative dopplenganger" for while is is "until".

To help reduce clutter, "modifier forms" are used to collapse the line by putting the confition statement at the end.

The case statement returns what is in the "when" or "else" clauses.  Or it will return nil if there's not match cluase that matches and and else statement.

false & Nil evaluate to false in an if statement.

The ?: operator acts as a compact if statement.
||= is used to express the expressions new value should be set to the old value unless that is nil.

The fastest way to create an array is to use %{what ever is in the array}.

hash = {:symbol => 'value'} or hash = {symbol: 'value'}/

Both each and map iterate.  However map can make a new array from what it iterates over.

The ! method can change an array.
