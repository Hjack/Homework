To add a new line to a string put the \n character at the end of the string (prior to the end quote).

Double quotes allow you to do more interpolation (i.e "#{variable_name} is happy today.")

"I like to eat pie".sub('pie','pizza')

gsub! warns you that the method may modify the string.

.sqeeze could be useful for removing and replacing characters.
.bytesize is interesting and could be very useful
.clear (makes strings empty) could be very helpful
.delete (returns a copy of the string with the characters at the intersection of the arguments deleted)
.replace (replaces content with corresponding data.)
