My favorite color is blue.

I am 1271808000 seconds old.  I am 40 yrs and 4 months old.  I am 14,720 days old.  There are 86,400 seconds in a day (60x60x24) so I multiplied this by the total number of days old I am.

A string is a sequence of characters.  Strings are found in quotes when assigned to a variable.

Double quotes allow you to use string interpolation.  Single quotes do not allow you to use string interpolation.

Here's one way to use a quote mark inside of a string...
puts 'What\'s Up?'

A variable is a character (or set of characters) that points to (or holds) a value.

Here is an example of interpolation...
name = "Chuck"
puts "Hello #{name}!!"

Here is an example of concatenation...
name = "Chuck"
slogan = "likes glitter."
puts name + " " + slogan

to_s and to_i are methods that convert objects to strings and integers respectively.  They are useful when needing to concatenate a string with an integer.  Ruby will not allow you to concatenate a string with a integer so the integer will need to be converted to a string.

*Even*

You call a method on a variable by listing the variable followed by a "." and the name of the method. Ex. name.length

To generate a random number between 1 and 20 use rand(1..20).

To define a method...
def greeter name
  print "Hello ", name
  end

To define a method with 2 variables...
def addition(a,b)
  return a + b
  end

If the method needs 2 arguments and you post 1, you will get an "Argument Error" message.

Yes, you can use a variable created outside a function can be used inside of a function.  It isn't a good idea and can cause errors.

If you don't explicitly return a value from a function, "nil" is returned.
